# Conversion Rate
The project is from the book [A collection of Data Science Take-home Challenges](https://datamasked.com/).

## Project Intro/Objective
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts conversion rate and come up with ideas to improve revenue based on the model.

The raw data has users who hit the site: whether they converted (bought something when they visited the website) or not as well as some of their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are repeat users and the number of pages visited during that session (as a proxy for site activity/time spent on site). The project is to:
* Figure out the key drivers of the conversion rate.
* Predict conversion rate
* Come up with recommendations for the product team and the marketing team to improve conversion rate

### Methods Used
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Confusion Matrix
